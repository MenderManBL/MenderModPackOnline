Dodge the teapots. They will kill you on touch. Also, do not stand where there is no visible ground. That will also kill you. When you get to the end, the difficulty increases and you get sent to the yellow platform so that you can watch everyone else get pwned. New: Everyone is now round!

(NOTE FROM MENDERMAN: I disabled the script that turns everyone round. If you really want, it's still in there and you can still turn back on)
