This won the "Most Horrifying" category in the RSBC Contest. It has many secrets, deadly ghosts, stuff that make you jump, teleporters, and I still plan to add more. :D *Latest Update* Where do I begin? Ok, first I changed the lightning... then I added a feature where a ghost might follow you and kill you, then I did a few updates on the kid on the bed...
