**April 13th 2009: Updated the place in response to the addition of the Wood material.** Ever need a place to sit back and relax? The Meng Mountain retreat is the place to be. Here, you can hike, sit back and relax, take a stroll through the nature trail, and even take a dip in the lake. There's no goal for this place; just relax! If you feel like being a daredevil, take a ride down the river when you hit the top! XiaoXiaoMan; first to visit and make it to the top.
