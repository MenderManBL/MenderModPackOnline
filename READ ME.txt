**SINCE ALL THE ASSETS ARE LOCALIZED: YOU MUST HAVE OTHERS DOWNLOAD THE ASSETS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO SEE THE ASSETS ONLINE!**

Most maps, if possible, are sorted in the folders by what version they are (if the version came out in 2010, it will be in the 2010 folder). If the version is unknown, the maps are place in the year that they were released.

#----CREDITS----#
Most of the maps come from esz's Roblox Place Archive v2.4.3 and Rchive
Huge thanks to XiaoXiaoMan for releasing his own places

#----CHANGELOG----#
v1.6 (The Cleanup Update)
- FINALLY a mid 2009 client!!!
	- Huge thanks to Natalie on the Roblox Client Search discord for telling me the solution
	- Also huge thanks to Bitl for putting up with my constant questions lmao
- Clients in general have been patched to higher standards (if you'd like to know how, check #modding in the Novetus discord)
- Every single place has been reconverted and fixed
	- Now there are two versions of the modpack, one with redirects and one with assets
	- So many places have had their versions swapped around I'm not listing them here
	- Needless to say, this update is mega not compatible with previous versions
- Added 2007 - ROBLOX World Headquarters
	- This is the one with two buildings instead of just one
- Added 2009 - Belmont Mountain
- Added 2012 - Survive the Tsunami
- Added 2012 - The Complex V4
- Moved ROBLOX World Headquarters to 2007
- Moved Builderman's Vacation Sim! to 2008 and renamed it Builderman's Vacation Sim! Relax to survive!
- Moved Jail Break to 2010
- Moved Ninja Temple Training Dojo to 2010
- Moved CrazyRobloxians Neighborhood! to 2012
- Renamed 2010 - 2fort to 2010 - XiaoXiaoMan's Team Fortress 2
- Removed 2006 - Haunted Mansion (Fixed)
- Removed 2007 - Mustafar
- Removed 2008 - Be Crushed By A Speeding Wall
- Removed 2008 - Plane Crash (Localized)
- Removed 2008 - Titanic
- Removed 2009 - Pipe Riding (Localized)
- Removed 2016 - Demolition Derby (Localized)

v1.5 (The Anti-assetcache Update)
- All games have been updated to draw assets from a new folder, MenderModPack, instead of assetcache
	- This means that previous versions of this modpacks are incompatible with this one (maps wise)
- Added 2009MS (Mid 2009 Simulation), a modified 2010L client to look like mid 2009
	- The next best thing (I cannot get any 2009 clients to work, at all)

- Added 2008 - Fencing
- Added 2008 - paintball

- Added 2009 - Pipe Riding (Localized)
- Added 2009 - Roblox Laundromat
- Added 2009 - The Underground War
	- I felt like including this because the one included with Novetus isn't localized, and it seems to have been a server rip. This is an actual place file from 2009 (The Underground War wasn't made until early 2009, beforehand it was Boat Wars).
- Added 2009 - Truckers and teens 3
- Added 2011 - Happy Home in Robloxia
